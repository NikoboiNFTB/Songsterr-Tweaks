# Songsterr-Tweaks

My collection of tweaks for [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com).  

## Scripts included

>> Note: One-click-installation needs Tampermonkey installed (and set up for Chromium)

1. **Auto-Continue Playback ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Songsterr-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-continue-1.2.user.js))**
   - Automatically clicks **"Continue with interruptions"** button when the prompt appears, so playback never pauses.  
So fast you can barely tell it's pausing.  

## Extensions included

1. **Search on Songsterr ([install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-on-songsterr/))**
   - Adds "Search on Songsterr" to the right click context menu.
