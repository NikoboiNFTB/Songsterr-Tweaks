My collection of tweaks for [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com).

## Extensions

Adds "Search on Songsterr" to the right click context menu.

## Userscripts

### Auto-Continue Playback (install)

Deprecated. The Songsterr website seems to have been updated, and I can't seem to figure out how to automatically click anymore. You win, Songsterr.
